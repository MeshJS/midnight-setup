# Governance

## Decision-Making

This project is maintained by the core maintainers listed in `MAINTAINERS.md`. Decisions are made through public discussion in issues and pull requests.

## Proposals and Changes

- Small changes: submit a PR and request review.
- Significant changes (architecture, breaking changes, roadmap scope): open an issue and include a brief proposal before a PR.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are expected to:
- Review changes in a timely manner
- Enforce project standards and security practices
- Keep documentation and roadmap current

## Conflict Resolution

If maintainers disagree, the default approach is to seek consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, the lead maintainer may make a final decision after a 7-day public discussion period.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant. Reports should be sent to the security contact listed in `SECURITY.md`.
